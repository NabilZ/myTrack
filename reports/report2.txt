1. What has your group accomplished since the last report?
We have set up version control and initialized a repository for our project.  We have also set up our development environments to integrate with version control.

We have also partially completed the requirements analysis, and finalized our system's core features in the process.

2. What are your group's "To-Do" items for the next deliverable?
By our next deliverable we hope to have a better understanding of creating a graphical interface for our app, including familiarizing ourselves with relevant Android APIs.

We also hope to have at least a nontrivial amount of the user interface completed.

3. What are your group's current problems and plans for solving them, if any?
Because none of us have previously done Android development, we are unfamiliar with most aspects of Android development, from APIs to the development process.

We plan to solve this by further familiarizing ourselves with the Android documentation in an ongoing process that will last throughout the duration of our project.

4. Do you have any other comments?
